A major issue with antiretroviral drugs is the mutation of the virusâ€™ genes. Because of its high rate of replication (109 to 1010 virus per person per day) and error-prone polymerase1, HIV can easily develop mutations that alter susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs. The emergence of resistance to one or more antiretroviral drugs is one of the more common reasons for therapeutic failure in the treatment of HIV.
In the paper hivPNASarticle.pdf, a sample of in vitro HIV viruses were grown and exposed to a particular antiretroviral therapy. The susceptibility of the virus to treatment and the number of genetic mutations of each virus were recorded. It is not necessary to read the paper, but if you are curious about details of those genes, please check it out.
We have two goals for this data: Inference: can we find some gene whose mutation seems to be most related to susceptibility? Prediction: can we fit a model that can predict whether the therapy will be effective given a virus with a set of genetic mutations.
